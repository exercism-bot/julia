# This is an auto-generated file. Please don't edit this file directly.

# This file is automatically generated by merging two files:
# 1. The Exercism-wide labels: defined in https://github.com/exercism/org-wide-files/blob/main/synced-files/.github/labels.yml)
# 2. The repository-specific labels: defined in a `.appends/.github/labels.yml` file (optional)
#
# If you want to use additional labels besides the Exercism-wide labels,
# don't edit this file directly but instead create a `.appends/.github/labels.yml`
# file within this repo.
#
# Any changes to the repo's `.appends/.github/labels.yml` file or the
# Exercism-wide `labels.yml` file will automatically result in this file being
# regenerated and the labels being updated. This typically takes 5-10 minutes.

# ---
#
# These are the Exercism-wide labels which are shared across all repos.
# The Exercism-wide labels are used to show "tasks" on the website, which
# will point users to things they can help contribute with.
